  <h2> Goal</h2>
  <p> This website was created for the hackathon known as HATCH, a yearly program organized by About HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology and is designed to challenge professionals and students to rise to the given challenges and create something ot benifit humans in some way. This teams challenge is the following: </p>
  <b> Security One: </b>
  <p> As we advance our ability to interpret the human genome and the technology performing DNA sequencing advances, the ability to identify individuals solely from a DNA sequence is possible. One of the most famous uses of this ability was in the identification and ultimate arrest of a man suspected of being the Golden State Killer, breaking open the case after more than three decades. It is clear that the use of genomic data in this case was used for good, but what if it werenâ€™t? How do we protect genomic data from getting into the wrong hands? Researchers and investigators need access, but what about marketing firms looking for the perfect targets? Or someone hunting a person in witness protection? Security One is an open-ended cybersecurity challenge to protect genomic data. </p>
